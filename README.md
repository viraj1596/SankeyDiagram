Data Visualization - Sankey Diagram 

Sankey diagrams feature directed arrows that have a width proportional to the flow quantity visualized: if a flow is twice as wide it represents double the quantity. Flows in the diagram can show e.g. energy, materials, water or costs. Within a Sankey diagram the directed flow is always drawn between at least two nodes (processes). Thus it shows not only flow values but also information about the structure and distribution of the defined system. So they are a great alternative to common flow or bar & pie charts.

They are gaining popularity in energy management, facility management, process engineering and process control and many other kinds of data visualization.

Sankey diagrams are really fascinating to see. I have been mesmerized by these for a while now. They often show up on Tableau Public as you traverse through the gallery. I have tried replicating Sankey Diagram on Tableau, however, the data prep process is extremely arduous which led me to find out if there’s an easier alternative out there.

I found the solution with Python – Pandas. When it comes to data prep, pandas will have your back.
